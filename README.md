# Random Name Generator in Rust

Confused about naming your project? 

Try these names ... they are bad I know, but it's good to have something than having nothing.

## Quick Start

```console
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/random_name_generator`

Defaulting to 6 characters length and 6 total words

$ cargo run help
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/random_name_generator help`

Usage:
cargo run <how-many-words> <number-of-characters>

<how-many-words>       : integer
<number-of-characters> : integer (Note: <number-of-characters> must be even)

```
